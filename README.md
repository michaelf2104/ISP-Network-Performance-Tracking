# ISP-Network-Performance-Tracking
A Python-based network analytics tool leveraging RIPE Atlas, InfluxDB, and Grafana to optimize ISP transit, peering, and caching strategies through real-time monitoring and data-driven insights. ðŸš€  ðŸš€  ðŸš€  

---

## **ðŸŒŸ Key Features**  

âœ… **Automated RIPE Atlas Measurements** â€“ Continuously collects latency, packet loss, and routing data  
âœ… **InfluxDB Integration** â€“ Efficiently stores time-series network data for long-term analysis  
âœ… **Grafana Dashboards** â€“ Provides pre-configured visualizations for easy monitoring  
âœ… **Peering & Transit Cost Optimization** â€“ Helps ISPs evaluate cost-effective routing strategies  
âœ… **Docker Support** â€“ Deploy the entire system in a containerized environment
